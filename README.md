# The Trek
<em>The Trek</em> is an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure style survival game for iOS that I built as an independent study during my senior year at Asbury University. Written in Swift using the Xcode environment, the game immerses you into Benâ€™s journey as he struggles to survive against a harsh blizzard in the wilderness of northern Pakistan. The app was released to the App Store in May 2017 and can be downloaded for free on iOS.

Although this project is just a sample of my work in iOS, it does stand as the largest, most rebust project I've worked on, incorporating user data, a dynamic messaging system, and system notifications. It took roughly 240 hours to develop, primarily as coursework for my Media Communications degree. Since then my work on it has been mainly to optimize it for newer devices and iOS versions.
